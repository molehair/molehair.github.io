      <description>There was online learning camp at elice.io regarding Machine Learning(ML). I knew the content was hot those days(and still is), and enrolled the class.
The programming assignments were easy because of utilization of pre-implemented code. I just filled blank space with some codes. That&amp;rsquo;s why I have to do study ML again for myself. Four weeks was too short to take the regular course of one semester, which I expected. However, the good thing was that I knew the subjects that ML deals with.</description>

      <description>A reversing lecture was held June 5, 2015. by HIT lab for undergraduate students who were participating dissertation project, and some of students in software department. The course materials were [Easy Keygen], and [ImagePrc] at reversing.kr. Thank you for your attendance even upcoming final exam.</description>

      <description>SKKU bug bounty(2015. 5.4. – 5.15.) was the first bug bounty held among universities in Korea. Though there was a limitation about target sites, it was not bad considering the fact that it was the first try.
I found one that steals name, site ID, department, student ID, cellphone #, address, and email of members of Sungkyunkwan univ. including professors, and staffs as well as students regardless of graduation. I wish they break the limitation, not just some sites, i.</description>

      <description>Analysis and Implementation of Remote Code Execution through Flash Player Vulnerability and Crafted Web Site
Implementation of CVE-2014-0515. Not bad that I explored some innerwork of Flash player.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief procedure about how my work operates.
 The attacker runs a web server and builds a site that uses the malicious flash player file. A victim connects to the site. Note that anyone can be a victim if he/she connects to the site without patched Flash Player.</description>

      <description>An open lecture was held by HIT lab regarding basic reversing skills for undergraduate students. Students who were interesting in reversing participated in the lecture.
Poster
Four classes for two days(2015. 4.7 / 4.9), I lectured the last one. I recomposed this exploit which includes stack overflow, how to build a PoC, and what payload could be.

      <description>As a senior in Mechanical Engineering, I was demanded to participate in a project for my diploma. Among many projects, one in RISE lab intrigued me. The project entailed programming skills as well as knowledge of mechanical engineering.
Problem:
 Given a range sensor, make a mobile robot navigate a corridor environment. Full exploration is proven by acquiring the entire map.
 Generalized Voronoi Graph(GVG) is one of famous methods for a mobile robot to walk through corridor areas.</description>

      <description>Check out this video for information about Robot competition, powered by RISE lab.
It was during the class named Design Laboratory on Vibration and Dynamic Systems on the Spring, 2014.
Here is our team&amp;rsquo;s product.
          Given some elements; three motors, two laser sensors, one sonar sensor, and peripheral parts, it was hard for us to defeat each stage in 3 minutes, especially the challenges including collecting blocks, and climbing up a slope.</description>

      <description>ConnApp is a mobile app competition, one of subprojects of Seoul Accord. Our team(Kiyeol Lim, Jiman Hwang, Dongeui Kim) made two simple apps(a provider and a beneficiary) that communicates each other over inaudible frequency.
In a market, each section has one or more providing speaker, making an inaudible sound. On the other hand, a shopper&amp;rsquo;s smartphone operating the beneficiary app receives and analyzes the sound, and shows a web page provided by seller.</description>
