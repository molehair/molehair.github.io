      <description>iRRAMx is a static C++ library that provides functionalities for rigorous scientific computations. It is designed in the way that it extends iRRAM. iRRAM is another C++ library that provides exact real-number computation. iRRAM provides data type REAL for real numbers and primitive operators for the field arithmetic of real numbers. They are computed exactly in iRRAM such that they do not introduce any rounding errors! Going beyond and based on those primitive operations, this extension provides more advanced data types and operations for continuous mathematics.</description>
