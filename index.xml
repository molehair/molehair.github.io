It provides data type REAL for real numbers and primitive operators for the field arithmetic of real numbers. Numbers are computed exactly in the sense that they do not introduce any rounding errors! Going beyond and based on those primitive operations, this extension provides more advanced data types and operations for continuous mathematics.</description></item></channel></rss>
